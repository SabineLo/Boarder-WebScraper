Why?: Doing this because I frequently cross the Tijuana-San Ysidro border and often times the lines are very long so I want to know when the best time for my family and I is to go to Tijuana


Goal: Show data from ready lane tracker using python libraries have to check if im able to use this data

Questions to be asked: Best Time to go?
Best day to go?
Worst time to go?
How wait time decreases/ increases over time?
Average time?
Why more wait time friday? Because jobs
Wednesday more wait time swap meet?
Saturday-
Streets close? cause more border wait time?
Analysis
Correlation Analysis: Look for correlations between wait times and external factors (holidays, events in Tijuana, etc.)

In Progress: Scraping the correct data

Checked: I am able to use the data I checked the copyright :DD
